# 👋 I'm Azra — Builder, Problem Solver, Visionary

**Full-Stack Engineer • AI/ML Systems • FinTech • Quant Finance • Research Fellow**

I build technology that doesn't just work — it changes how people interact with the world. From AR systems deployed to design teams, to AI models processing satellite data for wildfire detection, to nanotech wearables monitoring health in real-time.

**Currently:** Shipping products that scale. Previously: NASA Fellow, $1K hackathon winner.
